CG',"On of the problems with this set, the only thing I did not like is the size of the bottom plate. The plate is too small and the top plate is too large. I have had no issues with this plate, it is very thin and holds a lot of liquid. I would not recommend this product. Very good quality. Can't wait to use it. I just bought this to use in a hamper. I like that it's so easy to store. I've used it for a year and it is working great. I'm very happy with it."
CG',"Pro it seems comfortable. Cons; first, it doesn't feel comfortable. Second, the handle has a slight clunk. Third, the lid is a bit too short. The lid is still very comfortable. I can't imagine how this could be improved. I'm not a fan of the sticky feel of plastic and it is a little uncomfortable. So I will probably not buy this product again. However, I would not have given it five stars if it were not for the fact that the handle is a little short."
CG',I just opened this item and it was the best. I will keep my review for a couple months. If you want to get a solid product then the Treme Tops should work for you.

I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage. I also like that the blades are larger than I thought. It also helps to keep my blades clean even if I accidentally scratch them."
CG',I have an old yellow one and it was very thin but it was perfect for the baby and we loved it.  The plastic parts are very sturdy and we use them often.

It has a very nice height for the baby and it is pretty strong.  I like that the rubber parts are not too firm to get into the mold.

It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating.

I would not have given it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that the cover is not quite as thick as the carpet. I am happy with it and am happy with the price. It is a very good product for the price. The only negative is that I can't find a box of these for the price. I have only used them once so far and they are very good quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very nice looking. I have not used it yet but I will update when I do. I got this for my daughter's first birthday party. She loves it!  I was very happy with the size and the quality. It is made from sturdy bamboo. I was able to use it on the bed and it is great to hold."
CG',"This is a nice little vacuum. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of very small plastic bags.  The plastic bags are so small, it's difficult to get the vacuum in the right position.  If I had to pick up a lot of dirt, it would be a bit harder to get the vacuum in the right position.  But it's just a cheap vacuum.I bought this for my wife as a gift. She loves it.  She is very happy with the color.  I love that it is made of glass.  She loved it and she is very happy with it.I bought this as a gift.  I had some other candles and this one does the job perfectly.  It is a bit smaller than the candle that I had before, but it is not the issue I was expecting.  It is a bit larger than the one I was expecting.  I would say it is a little smaller than the one that I had before.  The price was right.  I would not recommend this product.I love these! They are very strong and the fabric is very soft. The color is wonderful and the fabric is very soft. I was worried that the material would be a little more ""sheer"" but it is really"
CG',"I understand why this has become a part of the ""backpacker"" market.  If you're an extra-wealthy, affluent person, the wallet is a great choice.  If you're in the market for a thin, functional, thin, compact, and functional wallet, then this is the one to buy.  I can't wait to use it as a pocket.  I will buy another one for my husbands closet.  I like that the very first one I got was a little too small for my smaller pockets.  This one is a great size for a larger pocket.  It's definitely a better value for the price.This is a very good, very sharp knife.  I have to say it's not as sharp as a regular knife.  I was able to cut down the number of times I wanted to cut a steak in this knife.  I'm not a big fan of sharp knives, but this is a good knife for a lot of uses.  I like that it has a very sharp handle and that it is made of stainless steel.  I was very impressed with the fact that the blade is not a bit more expensive than a regular knife.  I would recommend this knife for anyone wanting to sharpen their knives and not have to worry about their knives"

I'm very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I wanted something that would last a long time without damaging the glass. I was quite surprised to see that the stainless steel on this one is a good quality, even if it is a bit too heavy for my tastes. I love that it is made of glass. It is super easy to clean. I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working as I hoped. I would definitely recommend.I bought this to replace my old one, it is a good size and sturdy, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It does not have the finish of the old one. It has a plastic grip that keeps the lid from being stuck.

I would say it is a good size and would be very useful for kitchen use, I would recommend it for the size of a large pan.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my little old mattress and it's a nice size. "
CG',"Really looking forward to next time. Great quality and comfortable for a travel mug. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. The color is nice and deep. It is a good size for a size 9. I use it for tea and also for a gift. I love the color and the size. I am very happy with this mug. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake cookies for her kids. She loves it, and it is a great size. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'm sure they will last for a long time. I have not used them yet, but will be putting them in a couple of weeks. They are perfect for my needs, but if they are not made well, I will make them anyway. Very nice quality."
CG',"I saw this at my local store and thought it was pretty cool. It's been a couple months and I think it's a great value. I think the price is right too. I had this for a few months, and it's still working fine. The only thing I don't like is the the color, which is a little on the bright side. I wish I had had gotten it a little earlier, but it's still a good product. I'd definitely recommend this item. I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to read books and has always loved to read books. It is a nice size for a small toddler and I like the color and the fact that it has a short handle to hold the book. I will be buying another one for my daughter as she is a bit of a book sleeper. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These are really nice quality sheets. They are made of polyester and they are made of a lightweight material. I have no idea how they would hold up to the weight of the mattress. I bought them for my daughter because she likes the way they stack up. I have a little old mattress and these sheets are a great value."
CG',"My wife wasn't pleased when I opened the box and found out it was for a small baby girl.

I had to replace the box and then the plastic one.

I've had it for a while now and I have no problems with the metal being uneven.  It's just not what I was looking for.  I would highly recommend this cover.My daughter loves this pillow. She loves that it is made of polyester. She loves it. I have it on my desk in the living room and she is always on the pillow and she keeps saying, ""Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"" Every time we put it on, she is saying, ""Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!""

CG',"I'm very disappointed in this product. The quality is just not good. The opener is a bit difficult to get off the dishwasher, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. The blades are not sharp enough to get the butter from the bottom to the edge of the pan. The pan is very thin and it will not hold the butter evenly. I wish I'd seen a better product. I'm not sure if the metal handles hold up well to hot water, but it is a nice quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update: After several months of use, I have noticed that the handles are too short. I would recommend that you buy the other brand and get a longer handle. It is a nice product for a good price.The foam is a little flimsy but I have used it for about a month and it still works. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

CG',"I am loving this expresso maker.  It is a good value and my only complaint is the extra coffee cup.  The plastic part is very small, and the inside is very large.  The only complaint is that the lid is very small.  This is a great product for the price.  I have used the most expensive non-perfume coffee makers in the past.  I would buy this again.  I am very happy with this product.This is a great buy for the price. I have used it a few times and it is well made. It's a little small but it's definitely worth it.I love the way it heats up.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not as quiet as a regular fan.  I was worried it would be loud but it's quiet enough for me.  I'm not sure if it would work as well as the fan I've used before.  But I'm happy with this purchase and will definitely buy another one.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for.

CG',"Background
This was a replacement for a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I had to replace a couple of the basic ones, but it worked fine.

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large for my machine. I found it was a bit too small for the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

But the box I received was a bit too large for me. I wanted to go to a store and get a large piece of equipment for my kitchen. I ordered this for the kitchen. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I am not sure why. I also ordered a small set of bowls for my kitchen. They are too large for me. I am not sure why. I would not order the smaller set.

I used this to make a little decorative plates for a gift for my grandpa and he loves it. The wood is a bit rough but I think it will be fine. I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to remove the metal from the wood rather than sliding it around on the surface of the wood. I would have liked to have a better feel for the wood.These are great, but the cotton is really bad.  I've used them for a few weeks, and I still have the cotton, but I've had no problems with them.

CG',"I put this up in the laundry room with the instructions for how to turn it on and off. It's not the best bed, but it is the best bed I have ever had. I have had it for over a year now and it's going strong. I ordered two for the bedroom and one for my living room. I'm very happy with it. I've had it for about a year now and I love it!Great.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!  It's easy to clean, it has a removable lid so you can keep your pot from burning, it's easy to clean and I can use it on my stovetop.  I don't have to worry about it burning up!  I just bought a second one for my second wedding and this one is perfect!  It's very easy to clean, easy to use and perfect for my new kitchen."
CG',"UPDATE: I swear the instant I opened the lid, it was cold.

The only thing I can say is that the plastic lid is very heavy, if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to open.I was excited to get this set as I had never used one before.  I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has a very nice shape and the weight is perfect for my needs.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt my hands shaking, but I've never felt any hand shake or feel the weight on my hands.  I like that it's a little bigger than my other set.  I'm very pleased with the quality and the price.This is a great pillow for a few bucks.  It has a good grip, but it is not as good as a traditional pillow.  I don't recommend this pillow at all.

I would definitely buy this one again.Very nice!  The reviews said it was a great size, but it's not.  I had to order another set of these for my grandson.  I love the color and they are great!Love this blanket!  It's very soft, cozy, and holds up very well.  I haven't had any problems with it breaking, but it's definitely not a ""scratch"" blanket.  It's just a little too soft and it does a good job of holding up to the hot weather.  I will be buying another set for my daughter as she is having a difficult time sleeping.  We just love it!I bought these to put on my curtains and it was pretty cute.  I bought a couple of them for my son's bed and they are great for that.  The color is exactly as pictured, and the fabric is softer and more soft than I would have liked.  I also like that the colors are more vibrant than I thought.  I have a little old guy and I bought a couple of these for my son and he is a bit of a tease to them.  They are a great addition to my bedroom and I would recommend"
CG',"I used this as a starter set and it worked just fine.  I have a large one and a small one.  I am using it for the beginning of the summer and it is still working well.  It is a little bit noisy but it is still working well.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the microwave to heat up my cereal without leaving my cereal on the counter or even touching the counter.  I have to scrub the bottom of the bowl to get it to turn on.  I love that it is made of glass.  It has a nice metal handle that is easy to clean.  I have not had any issues with it.I have been using this to keep my coffee hot for hours. It's awesome! It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my taste, but that's not really a problem. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong.Love it!I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is very lightweight and doesn't have the bulky look of a rug. It's also made of a durable material. The colors are a little darker than the picture but still look great. I'm sure you'll love it.I received this item as a gift.  The quality is good. "
CG',"I have tried the OXO (Cordless) and I have not found a difference. The cordless OXO is much better and is cheaper than the Cordless OXO. I have been using this OXO for about a year now and it has not moved. It is very easy to use and I can use it on my OXO. I just put the OXO in my microwave. I have a hard time cleaning it because it is so dirty. I would recommend this OXO for anyone who needs to clean a microwave or microwave oven. I have used it on a couple of my other OXO's and I like it so much I bought another one for my family. It is also a good quality. I am very happy with this purchase. Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It was a little stiff but that's how it was intended to be. She loved it!  I'll definitely buy it again. Nice, thick, easy to clean, and I like that it holds a lot of items. I have a ton of items in this bag, and I have a lot of items in the freezer. These bags are very convenient and easy to clean.

CG',"Until I bought this Bissell, I thought I would try something else. This Bissell does the job. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic cups in the pitcher, but it worked well. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a new one. I wanted a different set of glasses. I decided to get this one because I love the quality of it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I love these for our dinner table!  We use them every day. I have used them for a couple of months now and they are just as good as the ones we have used at home. I can tell you I am very pleased with the quality and the price. I have used them for about a month now and still love them!  I have not tried the rustic ones. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and the only thing I have not tried is the handle. I don't like it when I have to lift the cloth up to hang it and it would fall off the cloth. It's not a big deal but it's a problem when I have to lift it up and it's too small. I have tried using this one on my table and it works great. I've had this for about a month now and love it."
CG',"Update: 4/16/18 - It's been a couple weeks now and it's still working!  I'm just starting to get used to it.  I also bought the Tumbler, which is nice, but it's not really a value for the money.  This is still a good investment.  I'm not sure how I could get better than this!  I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product. I have been using it for a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little more flexible.

I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.

It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."
CG',This is the newer version of the original.  The two-piece lid is a little larger.  The top is a little smaller.  The lid is a little thinner.  The lid is a little smaller.  I would think it would be better to have two pieces.  I don't know how I would go about putting the lid together without it getting so thin.  I just put the lid on the bottom and put the lid on the top.  I'm not sure if I would be able to put it together without the lid on the bottom.  I'm sure it would be better if I put the lid on the bottom and put the lid on the top.  I would think that I would get it to be a bit thicker than I would like it to be.  I would have to give it a shot.  I would like to see it on a smaller scale.I really like these curtains. They are very cute and the colors are vibrant and vibrant. They are a bit darker than I expected but they are not too dark. The colors are a little darker than I expected but they are still lovely.I have a K-cup for my coffee maker and this is a good size.

I used this grill to heat up the Keurig, and it worked great.  I used it for the first time to cook with a single scoop of nonstick chicken broth, and the nonstick chicken made a very flavorful, flavorful chicken broth.  The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.

CG',"The Good:

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version. I'm glad I found this review helpful. It helps me to make my own decisions. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. Very good quality. Very good for the price. very goodI love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out.

I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.  I'm very happy with the size of this, and I have a lot of compliments on it.  I have a nice collection of cookies, and I love how it's a little smaller than the cookie sheet.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it's not a quality product.This is a nice looking set of 5 pillows.  They are beautiful and I love them.  I put them in my shower and"

CG',"My Kitchen Aid went south, and it was time to try something else.

The first one we bought was the Eureka, which is the cheaper model, but it is much better quality.

The second one we bought was the Nordic, which is the cheaper version.

We used it with a German Shepherd, which is the more expensive version.

The Nordic is just as good as the Eureka, but it is much better quality, so if you want to make your own Eureka, you'll want to try it with the Nordic.

The Nordic is a little more expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

The Nordic is made in the USA, so it has a good quality, but it is not the best quality as the Nordic is made in China.

The magnet is solid and well-made. It holds the magnet securely, but it doesn't hold the magnet in place.

I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well.

I have a lot of other things on my desk, too, but this one is perfect.I have a little old guy and I bought a small plastic towel for him that had a small plastic bag that was too small to fit.  He loves it and it holds his towel, but it's too big to fit.  I have tried a couple other towels from"
CG,"I was excited to get this set, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money you spend on it.  The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little more detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very classy curtain.love this!  it works well, but I wish it was more sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser for a baby shower.  They work great.  I used them for our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them for the bedding for a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.  I would definitely recommend these.  I was worried they might not last long.  They are great for the price.  I would buy these again.  I hope they last a long time.I've had a few of these for a few months now and they haven't cracked or cracked. I have tried a couple of them and they're all so much easier to clean. They're not so much thicker than some of the others I've tried, but they're still so thick and easy to clean"
CG,"""Works as advertised"" is a nice touch, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and keep them from falling over. I am using it for the instruction booklet.Great quality and nice color.  Just wish it came in a bit bigger.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.  I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure it will be better than the $200 item that I paid for it.  It works great and keeps the coffee hot for about 10 hours.  I haven't used it yet,"
CG,"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions for how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook. The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good dough hook.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is heavy and it doesn't have the wrinkles. It is very soft and nice looking. It also holds a lot of water and I like that it is made of an ultra-soft material. I bought this to protect my bathroom, so I could use it to put on a larger bathroom counter. The rug is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I'm pleased with the quality.I've used this for about a month now and have used it about 3 times so far.  It is a little pricey but it"
CG,"I decided this summer that I wanted something with a more substantial design. This is the perfect one.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I also like that it is not the only spatula on this list, but it is the only one I bought.I got this in the middle of the night on my first night of sleep. It arrived on time. It is a bit thinner than I had expected, but overall it is good quality. It is a little small for my queen size bed, but that's my fault. I have a queen size bed that is 8"" x 11"" and it has a 2"" thick sheet. It is made of solid"
CG,"I hesitated in spending the money on the quality, but I did. This is a nice one. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have a few items that I am returning, but I am not sure if it is worth it for the price. I will probably order another one. I have a friend who has a lot of work to do on it, and she loves it! I am very pleased with this product. Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all the time. I have used them for about a month now and still love them. I have not washed them yet, but I will. I will probably buy a couple of more of these at a later date. I have been using this for a few months now and I have used it more than once to create a new outdoor cafe/fiesta. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also easy to clean. I have not had a problem with the coffee tasting bad, but I do wish there was a way to protect it from the elements and not ruin it. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful. I am very happy with it. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I have been using it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. So I will keep it."
CG,"The overall size and capacity of this suction cup is good enough to make a small vacuum cup. I had a similar vacuum cup that was provided by a company called 4-Way. They had no issues with the suction cup. I would recommend this suction cup for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent. I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture. I have a hard time with drying them, but I do use them daily. They are great for my hands, but I can't say how much they do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow for a few bucks or more. It is sturdy, but very comfortable for a bed. It does not look like it was made out of plastic. It is a nice looking pillow, but not for a single person. I love this crockpot!  It is easy to clean, it is easy to use, and it is easy to clean!  I would recommend it to anyone!I have a cup of coffee every morning and this was perfect!  It made my morning coffee perfect!  I bought a second one for my son and it is a perfect size for his lunch!  It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. It is sturdy and easy to clean. I do recommend this coffee maker for the price!I purchased this for my daughter's room. It works great and keeps her hands warm for hours. The little ones love it!I love this pan."
CG,"These small 1/2 cup Rubbermaid cups have the design and function of a cupcake cup.  They are a great size for a gift, or to get the perfect cupcake for your kids.  They are great for baking, too.  They are thin and compact to hold a lot of things.  They are also easy to clean.  I have had several of these cups in the past and have had no problems with them.

CG,"My Mom asked me to go to the local store and I did. This is the first one I've owned.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the handles are very comfortable.  I love the fact that they don't come with a handle.  I can use the handle with a knife if needed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a knife that won't break if you want to sharpen it.I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to cook.  It was a gift for my son who was a huge fan of my cookbook.  The reason I got this was to make my son cook for me and he loves to cook for me.  My son loves to cook with me.  I was going to buy a second set of this because I really like the color and the finish of the books.  It's a really nice quality book.  I just wish it had a darker background.  I love that it has a small red tag that says ""Made in USA.""  I would also like that it has a description for the book that says ""Made in China.""  I also like that it has a nice green color.  It is really nice to have an accent that makes my son feel like he's a real person.  It is a perfect addition to my kitchen.  I also like that the book has a sharp edge that makes it easier to cut with ease.  It is very easy to read and works well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good cookbook.  This is a very good product"
CG,"I have a small blender that has a wide range of functions, and this is the first one I've used.  The motor is easy to use, and the motor is very quiet.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the blades with a single hand.  I just have to pull the blades away from the blade, and it will eventually melt.  The blades have a nice twist-able handle.  I love that they are made of glass.  I will be purchasing more of these.  The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.  I have also purchased the metal blades for my next blender.  I love the fact that the blades have a very soft edge.  I use these to slice a lot of vegetables and salads.  I love the fact that they are made of glass.  I love that the blades have a very soft feel to them.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  I also love the fact that they have a nice, smooth feel to them.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend these blades.I bought this to protect my coffee cup from frosting and baking.  The cup is sturdy and a great value.  I have tried several other types of coffee makers but never had any issues with it.  I have used the same cup for almost all the types of coffee I have used and the coffee still tastes great.  I am very happy with this product."
CG,"I have a whole set of containers and they look just like the ones that I have been using.

I had to replace a couple of the containers because the cover was breaking off.

The containers are in good condition, they are well made and look good.

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I ordered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the color and the color is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one for my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit more space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great for making cookies or cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the freezer.  These work great for that.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small for the little pillows. I think this is a good size for the room. It would be perfect for the kitchen, but not for the bedroom."
CG,"Well, I've been curious about this set and am very pleased with it.  The dimensions are just right.  The blades are nice and thick and the blades are attractive.  I love that it's made in China.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the knives.  I love that they're made in the USA and I can't wait to use them in China.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the blades when I buy them.  I've been using them for about a year now and they're still holding up well.  I'll be ordering more of these knives as they're not too big.  I'm sure they'll last for many years to come.Great product for the money.  Very good quality.  I was looking for a little more of a look, but I was tired of having to look elsewhere.  This is a perfect addition to my bathroom.  I like the size, but I am not sure how long it will last.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to grip your hand. If you do get it wrong you should definitely pay a higher price for a mat that will work.

CG,The knife is a well made knife and the materials are good.  The blade is sharp and the sheath is very sturdy.  I have used the knife for a week and it is still sharp.  It will be a great gift for my grandson or for my niece.  I received this knife at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.I've had this knife for a few years now and it's
CG,"I deducted one star for the size and quality of the item.  If you have a larger head than me, the sizing chart will not work for you.  I would say go with a medium.  It will be a little bit larger for my size.  If you have a large head, it will be a bit bigger.  If you are a medium, you will need to adjust the size to your desired size"
CG,"Pros:

It is sharp
Full Tang
Solid

Cons:

The picture doesn't show the finish

Overall, this is a decent knife. I had to replace a couple of the blades with a new one, and now it's a little smaller. I would recommend this knife to anyone. The shape of the rubber band is great for holding the pistol in place."
CG,Solid knife. I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  It is so small and light.  He also loves the fact that the blade is made of a metal.  It will cut your hand very easily.  This is a great knife for the money.  I have used it for a few years now and it is a solid knife.  I just wish it came with a
CG,"My son fell asleep right after a night out and decided to try it out. I was pretty nervous.  I had to get up and down by myself and figure out what I wanted to do.  It was really good to get this one up and running.  I had no idea what to expect.

I did get a little weird after a few uses.  I could hear my heart rate going up and down"
CG,Keeps you a little cooler and keeps you warm.  I also love that it's easier to use.  Great for emergencies.Great product and works great.  I have purchased other products by the same company and this one is perfect for me.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to
CG,"This is a very bright, bright, wide-angle flashlight.  This is the first one I've owned.  The front sight is very sharp, and the rear sight is pretty straight.  I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a problem if you're not careful.  I also like the orange dot on the front sight.  It has a very nice green dot, and I like the red"
CG,"This seat is large and comfortable. The only problem is that it comes with a small buckle that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the buckle is made, but it is definitely not a problem.

If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely consider this. I have a large frame and I can't imagine having to carry a heavier vehicle. I just can't imagine having to carry it"
CG,"Love my new mat!!! The material is strong and the instructions are clear. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the mat is a bit small, but it's a very large mat. It is still very comfortable to sit on. I wish it was a bit thicker. The material is a bit soft for a mat and it's not as thick as I thought it would be. I would definitely buy another one."
CG,"It's a cool convenient little tool. The only problem is that it's not really a strong one.

I had to replace the solid steel sheath with a solid steel sheath that I had purchased in the past. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product. The sheath is a solid steel, the sheath is a plastic and it is a strong plastic. I wish I had had the option to replace"
CG,I purchased this cover for my wife and she loves it. She also loves the fact that it is so small. I am 6' tall and we both had a lot of fun with it. It was a little difficult to get it on with me as it would have been too small. I also like the fact that the cover is not so bulky as some other covers I have used.
CG,This is my first time using this and the materials are good.  I have a large head and a medium head.  I am 6'5" and the cover is very large.  The material is very absorbent and will last a long time.  I am very pleased with the product.  I highly recommend it.I had to return it due to the fact that it was just too big to fit my wife's AR
CG,The EVO Stretching Strap with a Screwdriver Washer is a great product for the price.  The other two Stretches I have are the ones that you can't find in most stores.  I have been using this stretching strap for about a year and it has held up great.  I have also tried it on several other stretches I have tried.  I have had great results with it
CG,"Unfortunately, there were no batteries, and the only way to fix it was to just throw a couple of batteries into the ground and replace the batteries. The light itself is pretty sturdy, and the coating is pretty slick.

The only thing I wish it had is some sort of resistance to the charging. I have a portable phone, which can be charged on the fly, and the flashlight is just a cheap cheap plastic flash unit."
CG,"This bike is built so that it can be used in the cold weather, and I can't imagine a bike that is not built for that. The bike itself is sturdy, and it's comfortable to ride in. It has a strong handlebar for stability and holds a large amount of weight. The handlebar is also the most comfortable I've found and it is a strong enough handlebar for my purposes. The handlebar is made to"
CG,"The rubber flange assembly inside the gun is a little bit too tight. This is a major issue.

I had to replace the factory factory barrel with a new one. I used this to make a little smaller barrel. I am very pleased with the quality of the gun. The gun is a bit smaller than I expected and it is very easy to hold. I wish I could have bought a different gun with the factory barrel."
CG,I got this for target practice.  It's comfortable and it's easy to carry.  It is so small that it's not easy to get around.  It is very large that it's difficult to put in the trunk of your car.  This is a great choice for shooting and shooting with a pistol.  I also love the fact that it folds up so you don't have to carry it all the way around. 
CG,When it warms up this is an amazing quality product. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go camping.Great product and works great.I'm a 4'2" and 190 lb. swimmer and am extremely pleased with this vest. I ordered the full size and it fit perfectly. I will be buying a second pair of these to add to my collection. I was able to order the full size and the
CG,I bought this item as a gift and thought it would be a nice addition to my collection. It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large backpack. I have had no issues with it so far. I have had no issues with it getting into the pockets. It is very easy to open and close and I have not had a problem with it getting into my pockets. I have not used it to hold
CG,"I have several older versions of this and they work fine.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very fragile.

The only way to replace it would be to remove the plastic parts from the cover. I haven't found that to be the case, but I'll try it out for myself.

I just wish there was a way to replace the plastic"
CG,"Great sports umbrella.  Attractive, holds a large amount of water.  Also, it's a good sized umbrella.I had a lot of fun with this product and it was great.  The only thing I didn't like is that it came with a bunch of extra holes.  The first time I used it I was going to have to replace the holes on the front so I could use it again.  Now I have to"
CG,"This item is pretty good, it is a very comfortable fit and fits my hand well.  The other two I had were the most comfortable and the other was the most uncomfortable.  The only thing I would change is the size of the padding.  This is a very good fit for me.  I have a large chest and I can't tell you how comfortable this is.  I just can't imagine wearing it as it is."
CG,"A totally different workout from what I was used to. I did not need a rigid rack, but a pair of the Kydex pedals and the basic Teton pedals. I used these to do a couple of bench press exercises, and one for my bench press. I also used the Kydex pedals to do the most common type of bench press exercises. I've also used these for my bench press with the Kydex pedals."
CG,"These are ok for the price. The only problem is that they are small, I have one in my hand and the other in my pocket. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket. If you are going to use it for hiking, you can get a smaller one. I did get a size large and it fit perfectly. I also got a small for my son and it was a little small for"
CG,"I wanted a nice, roomy, comfortable, lightweight, comfortable fit. This is the perfect fit. The adjustable strap is nice, but the straps have a tendency to stretch and go off. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This product is excellent. Great for the price. I have used it for 3 months and have no problems with the product. I have had no problems with it."
CG,I used Grim Reaper when I bought the G3. I also used this for the first time. It's not the best but it's good enough for me.This is a great gift. It is well made and the size is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this for my daughter's bike to keep in her car.  She loves it.  She will probably just use it as a spare bike if she needs one
CG,"Great holster but needs adjustment.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one-handed release was very difficult.  I took the holster out of the holster and used the button to release it.  The next time I use it I will see if it would work with the one-handed release.  I will update the review after I have received the holster.

Update:  I have now used it for two weeks"
CG,"The belt is good. Nice and thick, with a comfortable fit. Also, the belt does not slide around so it is easy to carry.  The clip is a nice feature, and is easy to adjust.  The belt is a bit large for my size 4, but I have the large size.  I love the color, and the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I would not buy again.Great."
CG,"This chalk looks a little more durable than the regular chalk I use.

The only downside is that it's very hard to see.  The light is not as bright as it should be.  It's not clear how it will be useful if you don't have a flashlight.  I'm not sure how the light will work, but it's certainly bright enough to see.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive,"
CG,"For the price, this is a great addition to my AR-15. The only downside is that it's very hard to mount. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail. Otherwise it is very secure. The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod."
CG,"Picked this up for ground training. The quality is good and it fits my 2 year old just fine. If you are looking for a solid and effective way to use this, I would definitely recommend it. It is a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock"
CG,"I bought this for my son to wear as a Christmas present.  He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and the clear plastic coating protects the gun from scratches.  It is great for him to have a clean gun.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very pleased with the item and it is a great deal.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock."
CG,"I have previously bought a few of these and they are good enough.  They are a bit bulky and bulky.  The front sight is also not as good as the rear sight.

CG,"Love these! Perfect for a weekend trip, or even just for a weekend workout. I have them in a pair of the best quality, and they're the best I've found.I like it.  It's not a large, compact size.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day bike ride.  I'm very happy with it.  It has great durability and is great for running.  I am very happy with"
CG,"The zippers seem REALLY cheap.  I don't know why but it's because they are so expensive.  If you want to get a solid pocket knife, you're going to need these.  They are great.  I'm a bit disappointed.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made in"
CG,"I'm always a little skeptical of an item being labeled ""for cold weather"" or ""for indoor use"", so I had to get a few of these to test them out.  This is by far my favorite bag.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the product and the quality of the straps.  I will be buying more of these and having to buy more of them.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for an outdoor bag."

CG,"I bought two of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. If I had to say, they are the best out there. They do not slip or slip. They are not stiff like a stock. They do not slide. They are not slippery. They do not break. I did not want to be able to walk out of my car without them. I had to take them out of the box and they all"
CG,"Same as another review, I use it at the gym. I also wear it for the gym and it is so comfortable. The seams are solid and the seams are tight. The material is nice and soft. It is a good value for the price. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years."
CG,"4 stars only cause not enough room for the knee pads. If you have a larger knee pad, you may want to look at the video or you may be a little skeptical that it will hold up. If you do have knee pads, you may want to look elsewhere. EDIT: I've gotten a number of compliments on it. I've had it for about a year now and I love the way it looks."
CG,This lantern is the best one I have ever owned. I will be purchasing a second one and will update this review if I am not able to get the first one. Great light! The only thing I would change is the size of the size. This one is a little smaller than the one I used in my bike and it has a very small gap on the top so you could use it on a bike with a larger gap. Great.
CG,"i recently needed a new pair of shorts.  These fit perfectly and are just the right size.  The only thing I am not happy with is the fit of the pants.  The color is a little too pink for me, but it's not really that big of a deal.  They are actually a bit too small, which is weird because they are a little too long.  I would buy them again.  I'm not sure what to expect"
CG,"Ok if you got the old ones, you'd have to purchase a new one.Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  I used it to make a little makeshift fire starter in our house.  He liked it so much that he bought one for him.  He will probably use it for a lot of things.  It is very easy to set up and use.  The kit includes a little bit of"
CG,"The Bowtie is a useful tool for the wide variety of bow tie options that you can get. It is so small that it can be used to tie around a bowtie, and it is so light that it is easy to carry around. The bow tie is also very easy to use with other bow tie options. I will probably buy a second one for my wife for her husband's use.

I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they are"
CG,"It whistles, and is fairly easy to open.  The two buttons on the side of the cup are a little too small for the most typical desktop tasks, but otherwise the cup is pretty nice.  I would highly recommend this cup to anyone who wants a very compact, high quality, and easy to use device for everyday use.Very good knife.  It is a solid knife.  Sharpness is very good.  Very nice to have. "
CG,"I love this mat especially for the price. It is thick enough to hold up to abuse and is a great mat. The mat is easy to get on and off. The material is thick and soft and it is easy to clean. The mat is thin and holds up well. The only downside is that it is a bit heavier than I had hoped for. I think this mat could be a bit heavier, but I think I am happy with it."
CG,"This headband is as versatile as it gets. It is thick enough to cover your head and fits easily. The adjustable strap is nice, but the straps have a tendency to stretch and go off. The material is soft and feels like it will last for years. The strap itself is not the best, but it's a great addition to your pack. The pockets are a little small, but I like them. The handlebars are nice and adjustable, but the straps"
CG,"If I were only reviewing this product, I'd give it 4 stars for being a little expensive.

I had a friend who was a lifetime member of the Marine Corps and wanted to go to war in the Middle East and wanted to be able to carry his own gun.

CG,"Screws were too short to fit on the side of my Taurus G17. I ended up using a pair of the same size, but they're slightly too tight. The rifle is now just a little larger.

If you're thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely consider a 2x10x45 scope. I had to work on it a little bit more because I was getting a little annoyed that the rear sight on my rifle came"
CG,I bought this in the last two weeks and it is holding up very well. I have one in my glove compartment and it fits perfectly. The only thing I would change is I would like to have a little more room for a pillow case. If I had to give it 5 stars I would suggest to buy a larger one. I would also recommend the one with a zipper on the side for my keychain. I would not go for the larger one since it is
CG,Installed this tube on the weekend. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the TRS-38 rifle and it works fine. It is not waterproof so it will not last long. I would recommend this for the money.I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a pair.  I like that they
CG,I wanted to love this. I love the feel of the fabric. It's warm and doesn't move. The seams are solid and the fabric feels great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would buy it again. Very good value. Great for the price. I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the fence about this one. I bought a second one for her and she loves it.

CG,"This rest is easy to use and the quality is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very fragile. The rest is in good shape, and it's going to last a long time. I'm not a fan of the orange color, but the orange is a nice color. Overall, I'm very happy with this product. I love this product."
CG,"This line is awesome. Im not sure if the materials are good enough or not, but I'm very pleased with the quality and the fit. The ring itself is a great quality and is comfortable to wear.

I just bought a new one and used it for my 6th one."
CG,"Very pretty mat that came with it, and it is pretty sturdy. The only downside is that it is very thin. The material is very light and not so great as other mat matries. It is not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. I would recommend this mat to anyone who has a kid who wants a cheap mat that has great durability and is made from very durable materials. I am returning it."
CG,"Easily convert your trailer's lights into an LED lantern.  I also love that it's easier to install.  I had to replace the flashing light with the light from the flashlight.  The flashlight came with a few screws to loosen the screws.  This was an easy fix.  I haven't used it yet, but it will work great.  If you have a light that will make your commute more convenient, you can't go wrong with this one."
CG,"The perfect water bottle!!! These are an amazing quality and comfortable fit.  They have a strong edge to them and they are easy to clean.  The only drawback is the side panel is a little tight.  It will not stay in place.  This is an excellent product and should last a long time.

I did get a free shipping coupon on these for my honest review. I was not compensated for my honest opinion and am not sure how long that will last"
CG,"Adjusted it with the supplied spacer and the chain stays in place. Nice bag for the money. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. I used it to make a little makeshift camp stove in our basement. He liked it so much that he bought one for him. He will probably use it for a lot of things. It is made of very high quality materials and seems to last for quite a while."

I am very happy with the product and am sure I will be buying more as I go.

Update:

CG,I used this netting for a couple weeks with the stove set on a 4 person camp stove and we had a great time. I am using it for the colder months when it is not necessary to set up the stove in the basement. The poles are thin and compact. I would not recommend this netting as a net to keep things dry. I have not used it as a net but I do like the fact that it is made in the USA. I will buy another one

CG,Well actually my husband loves this. The only problem is that it's a little hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should work fine. But it's a little difficult to put on. If you are going to use it you should have a rubber band to tighten the screw to keep it from getting stuck. If you are looking for a solid grip then this will work fine. But if you are looking for a solid grip then this will not

The rubber parts are a little bit thicker than the rubber parts, but they're still pretty strong. The rubber parts are also very durable and have a good feel to them. They are a bit more expensive than the rubber parts, but they're still very good quality."
CG,"They fit like a glove, and the quality is good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very large.

The only reason I give 4 stars is that the mesh flap is a bit short for the straps.  I ended up going with a longer one, and it is a little longer than I expected.  This is not a big deal for me, because I have a very small body,"
CG,"Spray, wait 15 min while it's drying.  After that it's fine.  I just washed it before I had to use it.  The light is not as bright as it should be.  It's not clear how it will work for long periods of time.

CG,This is outstanding 750lb Paracord. I love the feel and fit of this paracord. It is so small that it is difficult to attach to the waist belt. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to carry a paracord. This is an excellent product. I love it. I have the option of using the plastic wrap on the front of the chain. I would buy it again. I am very happy with it.
CG,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong, and it's just a part of my job, not a person's.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the price. I ordered the full size and it's just a bit too small. I can't tell you how much I like it. I just can't get it to fit my AR.

They're very comfortable and I feel very comfortable wearing them.
CG,"Came from The Sweethome? Me, not you.  I've tried it for a couple of years and it's still working.  The only negative is the plastic part.  I've been using it for about a year and I can't use it as a battery pack.  The only way to replace it is to order one of the larger ones and then put a new one in.  I can't imagine I'd do it that way.  I think I'll buy"
CG,"great laser, it was easy to assemble and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.  The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one.  The bottom line is, it's a great laser and it will last a lifetime.  I highly recommend it!This is a great kit.

CG,"A nice self inflating ground valve. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using this for the Teton cover, and it does not fit well in the front of the Teton. If you are looking for a good cover for your Teton, this is the one. I had to return it due to the fact that it is very tight. I have not used it for any purpose other than a camping trip, or for anything"
CG,"this is the kind of thing you might want to try if you are going to be using them.

I had to replace the crank with the ring and the cover.  This is a bit of a pain in the butt to replace.  This was an excellent purchase.

CG,This holster is a good fit. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the plastic part would hold up to that. The only way to get it to hold up is to hold it upside down. The holster also comes with a small screw that is too tight. I have not tried to remove the screw yet but I will update my review if I do.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones
CG,"As the other reviewer said, this is the only one you need to keep in your pack.  It is so small that it will not fit in the trunk or under the pants.  The only thing I would change is to make it a little wider.  Otherwise it is very comfortable.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a pack full of stuff.Great product!I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful. I have a very small hand and it is"
CG,Put this on my. 40 cal. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the Taurus Glock 19 and it does not fit well. It will not fit a. 357. This is why I ordered the. 40 cal. It is a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable gun. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a gun that will last a long time.

The ball is strong and stable. If you are a golfer looking to get the ball to drop a ball, this is a great purchase.

If you are looking for a ball to drop from a golf cart or a golf cart with a ball, this is the ball for you.

I highly recommend this ball for the golfers that want to find a balance.

CG,"These fit perfectly on my Glock 22 and the chamber is very smooth.

The only downside is that the top is a bit too thick and the ring is a bit too loose. The only thing I would change is to make it a little wider. This is a great way to keep the ring from slipping off. I did get a little ragged on it a little but it's not a big deal. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their sights on their Glock 22.

CG,"just returned from a four day trip and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for me to put it on again. I would recommend this to anyone who has a knife with a hard plastic cover. I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean."
CG,"This thing is awesome. I have the wide brim and the cold weather hat. I just ordered a pair of the same hat, but they're the same size. I can't go wrong with this hat. I wear this hat for my gym workout and it's comfortable. I'm not a fan of the orange color, but the hat is a little too long. I would buy another pair. I'm not sure what to expect from this hat."

It is great for beginners. I would recommend it. I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear and wanted something more traditional for his military-style military gear. The metal is solid and a good quality piece of material."
CG,"I think this would have been an excellent addition to my range bag.

The only downside is that it's very small. The bag is designed to fit a Glock 19, and that means it won't fit in the trunk of a car. This bag is still large enough for a Glock 19.

The pouch is also a bit big for a Glock 19. It's a little small for a Glock 19, but it is still a good bag.

Overall, this bag is a great"

It was easy to clean and easy to clean."
CG,Best quality swim googles I use for the summer and winter swims. These go well with the swim cap and the swim cap I got.  The swim cap is a great quality and fits nicely.  It is a good size for the size I am and for the size I have.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large head and wants to wear a swim cap.Great product for the price. Easy to use and use. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones
CG,"Picked these up for cleaning and they are very well made. I also like the fact that they do not have the side seams, which is nice, but not a big deal. I have had no issues with the carpeting on them. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great deal. We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it."

CG,"Pretty much everyone I know who has the same knee issues says they are happy with the product and the quality. I had a friend who had knee problems for a while and was very skeptical that it was possible to use a knee brace. The one flaw I noticed is that the padding does not always match the bottom of the knee. I have had to work on these braces to see if it is possible to buy new padding. I am not sure if they are a good product for the price, but I would not recommend"

I tested it out in the woods and it works great. It's great for holding a flashlight and a couple of spare batteries in a backpack.

It's very bright. The light is very bright"
CG,"This product is very small and bulky, and the instructions are very confusing. I was hoping to get an extra large for the gun. The instructions are not clear, and it's difficult to get it to open. I was also hoping for a ""mini-flash"" with no instructions. I was disappointed. I had to return it. I really didn't want to spend more than I paid for it. It was an awesome buy, and I would buy again."

The only way to fix this is to loosen the strap around the belt and tighten it around the belt. That way, the straps will hang down and hang out over the edge of the belt. I will probably just put a new strap on the belt and use it as an extension to the belt.

I ended up going with the larger size. If you're looking for a magnifier that will be bright enough to see what you're shooting, this is the magnifier for you."
CG,"Tough to Remove, Easy to use. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This was a very large screw driver. I replaced the screw driver with a spare one. This was an excellent replacement. I have used this for a few years and I can say that it is a very good product. I just wish it came with a little more screwdriver. I have a hard time finding a cheap replacement for this tool."

The front of this tent is the most attractive to me and it is comfortable to stay in.  The poles are very sturdy and hold up to some heavy use.

I would highly recommend this pouch to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews are accurate. I purchased this to replace the defective thumb caps I had on my old bike. They are awesome. I recommend them. I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house.
CG,As others have noted this is an easy to use stove for cold weather camping. I have used it for two nights and it works great.  The stove itself is a great little stove that takes up little space.  The lid is very thick and the lid holds the lid securely.  It is a great stove to have when you are camping.  It is a little heavier than I expected but it does hold its shape well and is easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a portable stove. 
CG,"Pros: lightweight carbon trekking poles, an easy to carry and carry handle, and a sturdy handle.

Pros: the best seat, solid construction, the lightest price, and the best quality.

CG,"I'll keep it simple - it has the wide mouth part of the back that is the only one to be removed. The front part is also designed to be a little more difficult to reach with a small knife. The knife itself is a very thin blade - it has a lot of edge to it and is a bit heavier than I'd like. I think the knife is made for a kid, but I'm sure it won't last long with a knife like this. I'd suggest getting one for the adult."
CG,"I like the size, design, and the fact that it has a zipper that opens the top and closes the bottom. The front zipper is also designed to be tight so it doesn't slip down. It's not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. I haven't used it with a rain jacket, but I'll try it with a rain jacket. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I like that it's not expensive, and that it's made in the USA."

I have not had a problem with this one.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day camping trip.  I have had no issues with it since I first got it.  It does hold its shape well and is easy to clean with a wipe cloth.  The material is soft, durable, and seems sturdy.  I am not sure how long it will"

It's easy to refill and easy to clean. I haven't had any issues with leaking, but I'm not sure how long it will hold"
CG,I ordered this knife because it has the wide blade and I really wanted to like the handle. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to open and close.

The mount is very secure, and it is well built."
CG,"This thing is much more compact than the regular one. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid and usable light you'll need a lot more than that. Update:

I was able to get it to fit my 22lr machine and a 2x32x4 scope, which were both right on the mark. I also got a small scope with a small scope mount and an adjustable zoom. Both of these sights are better than the standard ones, but I'd say they would be better suited for the 21lr machine."
CG,"I love this backpack.  It has the wide brim which is perfect for my needs.  The extra space is great for a bed, a small blanket, or even a place to go to go to sleep.  It is a perfect size for my needs and is comfortable.

CG,"This pouch is perfect for keeping an emergency kit, a flashlight, or a small knife in one. I had to replace the ""tactical"" pouch with a 4"" thick plastic one. It was a little difficult to use for long trips to the beach, but the rubber felt to it held up well. I had to replace it with a 3/4"" thick plastic one. I highly recommend it for any emergency kit or a flashlight. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. This is a great design."

I just wish the straps were a little wider to allow more room for my phone, keys, etc. I also wish the strap was a little shorter.

CG,"This hand warmer works.  Not a huge deal, just a little bit of pressure to warm the skin.  Great for the cold, warm weather.  I wear a pair of these during the summer and they are comfortable.  They do not last long and I like the shape of the straps.  I have also noticed that they are very comfortable and not too bulky.  They are a bit tight on the wrist, but they are still very warm and comfortable.  I have not used them yet, but I have been using them for a while now.

I have a size 6, and they work great.  I have been wearing them for a few months now"

CG,"Seriously why aren't all socks made of the same material? I'm not sure if the material is durable enough to hold the socks in place. The material is not thick, it's thick. I don't think it's thin enough to hold the socks in place. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my core fitness program. This is not a ""best"" workout, but it is well worth the price. I feel like I'm going to have a really nice workout for the first time in a while. The resistance bands work great. The band is too short for my legs."
CG,"This seems like a really good set, and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. I'm very pleased with the purchase. I will definitely order another one if I'm ever in the market for a similar set.

Update: I've been using these for a while now and they are a bit difficult to close and close. I had to use a magnifier to close them. I just turned them on and they were pretty accurate.

CG,My husband was pretty happy with it and thought it would be a nice addition to his bike collection. I had to replace the crank with the H-frame to get it to work properly. He said it's a bit difficult to hold and holds a lot better than the H-frame. I did get him a replacement and it was a little rough. So I gave it a try and it works great. He said it's very lightweight and his bike is very easy to mount. The handlebar is a nice touch. I think it's a good addition to his bike collection. I would recommend it to anyone.
CG,"I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza with a 4 wheel drivetrain that is about as powerful as a 6 wheel drivetrain. The 2 wheel drivetrain is a bit of a pain to install, but it is a good value for the money. This is an excellent choice for the price.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier than I expected. It will probably not hold up over time. However, it will hold up for a while if you're careful about where you put it. I'm very careful about where I put it, and it does hold up well for that.

The only thing I wish I knew is that if you are a strong person like me, this is not a good value for the money. This is a very good value for the money. I highly recommend it. I had to return it due to the fact that it was just a cheap replacement. I used it for two weeks and it held up very well. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I really like the sizing. I was just too big and needed to get a smaller one. Now I have it in my pack and it fits perfectly."
CG,I have owned several of these. The only problem is that they are kind of hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should work fine. The only thing I would change is the size of the grip. This grip is a bit too small for my liking. I have a large and it fits me perfectly. If I had to guess the size I would say the right one. I am 6'1" and weigh 190 pounds. The length of the grip is about 1 1/2" and the width is about 1 1/2" and the width of the grip is about 1 1/2". They do not fit perfectly on my hands.

CG,I had a few projects that I wanted to try out but didn't want to spend a lot of money on.  The first one was to get the TRS-4 rifle and use it as a bipod.  I was very excited to try it out and find out that the TRS-4 was a great option.  I have a TRS-4 and the TRS-4 had a very bad case of rust on it.  It's very easy to clean it out of the case and the rust seems to be fairly low.  I put it in a bag with a little tape and tape that doesn't have a lot of friction.

I had to get a size down to fit him, so he is 5'4"" and fits great in the waistband. He is going to be a little taller than the other kids.

The only thing I wish it had a little more padding is the mesh flap on the back. The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it. Also, the zipper is very tight, and I would not recommend using it on a backpack, since it won't fit into the front pocket. The case is a good size, and it holds the keys, car keys, etc."

CG,This fitness circle is smaller than a regular gym bag. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid workout then this is the bag for you. The only thing I would change is the size of the padding. This bag is still large enough for me and a 2 person with a 2 person body type. I will probably only use this if I need to do something more than just a cardio workout. The padding is very soft and very comfortable. The material is very durable and works very well.

I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the road so I figured she'd just get a new one. But for the price, it's perfect.

I have not used them for any activity yet but I think I will be able to use them for my other uses.  I am very happy with this purchase.I bought this for my wife and her husband for Christmas and they love it. They have two children. They do not have to worry about them breaking the belt. It is very easy to put on and it is comfortable
CG,"The attraction was the simulated sunshade.  The two lights were also identical in size and intensity.  The light dimmed a bit and then the light returned to a dull white light.  I still liked the light, but it had some light leakage to it.  The sunshade is actually a bit brighter than the original one.  If you have a light source that is just a cheap LED, you can't beat the price.  It's very bright.  I have yet to find a light source that will last long enough for me to put it up on my vehicle.  It's definitely worth the money.

I have not used it for a full day of driving and it's not going to work for me.  It's going to be a good upgrade"
CG,"I am seriously loving this little knife.  It is very sharp and sharp, I have one in my hand and the blade is a solid steel with a very solid edge.  The edge is very well made and the handle is a very thick stainless steel with a sharp edge.  I love it.  I have the option of a medium-sized version with a strong edge.  I just can't get enough of this knife for my needs.  It's very well made and it is very light weight.  The handle is very nice and comfortable.  I just wish that it was more adjustable.  I have used it a couple of times and it seems to hold up very well.  I would definitely recommend this knife for those of us who are not concerned with pocket knives. "
CG,"I know your thinking you are an amateur with a bullhorn, but this is a real one.

I had a friend who was a professional bull horn player and he was impressed by it.

He said it was a very good deal.

It was very easy to install.

The only thing I did not like about the horn is the lack of the traditional round shape.

If you are looking for a sound that is a little more realistic, this is a good horn for you.

I highly recommend this horn.

If you have a bad horn and would like to try it out, don't hesitate.

I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.

Bought this for my husband and he loves it!"

CG,"They're fairly cheap but not that expensive.  I've used them on my bikes for a couple years now and they're holding up great.  The light is a bit brighter than most but it's still pretty bright.  I'm hoping it lasts a while.  If you have a light that's not as bright as mine, I'd be more inclined to buy another one.

Update:  I've installed the light on my M&P Shield, and it's still working fine.  I'm going to try a couple of other options.

Update 2:  I've found that it is really difficult to get it on.  It takes a lot of work to get it on.  If you don't have a light that's not as bright as mine, I wouldn"

I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft. I'll be keeping it at my home to get a better grip on it.

I used it to make a little makeshift bench for a bench for a car.  He has used it for a long time.  He says the bench is a great addition to his bench.  It is made of very thin material and has a nice feel to it.  He says that it is very lightweight and very easy to use.  The included bench does not seem to hold up well to the use.  The material is a bit stiff at first, but it has become stronger over time.  I am hoping this will be a good addition to his bench for the next year.  I will update this review if I see"

I was able to get it all the way up, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.

CG,I have read some of the reviews and thought it would be a nice addition to the bike.  It's not the best but it's good enough for a couple of rides and it's worth it.  It's a little thin for a car but I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I have a 11 year old daughter and she's riding with a daughter who is 6'1" and about 150 lbs.  She rides a little bit a bit more so she can ride with her boyfriend but she rides a little bit more when she's riding with her kids.  She has had a lot of fun with it and it's nice to have a spare.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the front wheel.  It's not a good quality wheel but it's nice to have
CG,The plastic inside that you use to seal the bottle is a bit thick for my taste.  It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large bottle that you could get in the way.  I think it might be better to just keep the bottle with the seal.  I also think it will be a bit more difficult to clean the bottle if you have a large bottle with a larger bottle.  The plastic bottle holder is perfect for cleaning the bottle if you're using it for the purpose.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs a larger bottle.  It is definitely a better choice for keeping the bottle in the pocket.  The reason I like this bottle is because it has a lot of room for my phone and I can easily open the bottle and close it with the

I have used it for a year and have never had any problems with it. I use it for my elliptical workout and it has lasted me years. It is easy to use and it has a nice feel.

I'm glad I found this. I have used this for a couple of months now. It is very easy to use and to set up. It is very quiet. I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car. I would recommend this to anyone."
CG,This is my third pair.  I wear the knee pads for a lot of work and this one is a little too tight.  The sleeves are too tight and the inside of the pants is too tight.  It's a little difficult to get them in and out of the way.  I'm a big guy and I'm very satisfied with the quality of these pads.I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. This gun is super light and easy to carry. The gun fits nicely in my pack and holds a lot of ammo. I would definitely recommend this gun to anyone.Very good product. Very good quality.Great quality. Love it!Easy to install. I have no problems with this. I have had this on my Trek Trek
CG,"The Iluminated  reticle system works well and the materials are good.  The reticle does not slide around so it is a bit of a pain to put on, but it is pretty easy to adjust.  It does not have a multi-function button which is nice.

I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review.I ordered this to add to my core fitness program.  This is not a ""best"" workout but it is a good workout for me.  I feel like I'm going to be getting stronger, stronger and stronger, but I'm not sure what it will do.  This is a good workout for me.  It is not a full-body workout and does not mean ""top of the range"" but a good workout for me.  I wish I had the option of switching between the two.  I wish the workout was on a"
CG,"I saw this at a local sporting goods store and decided to purchase it for my daughter. It is so small that it is a must have for her. She is very large and it is a little difficult to carry in her backpack. This is an excellent product and should last long enough to keep her happy. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry a gun safely in a backpack. These are great for putting on some goggles. They're not super tight, but they don't fog up the face. I'm very happy with them. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs. They're a little too big for me to wear on my face, but they're well worth the money. Great product, great price. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't had any issues with them on my bike."

CG,"After receiving my Aircee  (Cordura) in January of 2014, I was excited to try it out. The design of the cordura is very attractive. I used it to make my own makeshift swim shorts in a pool. This was an excellent choice for me. I used it with a portable phone, a tablet, and a book. I also used it to carry my new Amazon Fire TV and an iPhone 6S with a camera attached. The phone is very light and easy to use. I love that it has a built-in camera and has an easy to use screen. The cordura is not as thick as a standard cordura and I would have liked a thicker cordura for my phone. It is also a very comfortable, low profile cordura. I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly."
CG,"For the price, this is a great addition to my AR-15.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod.

I'm considering purchasing another one of these for my AR-15.

CG,"I just don't like that it has the wide mouth part of it.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get out and then open the lid when you close it.

The only way to open it is to use the bottom flap to open the lid.

I'm not a fan of the orange color.

I think the orange color is a good thing for the outdoors.

I'm not sure what else to say about this product.

I would recommend this product to anybody.I love these gloves. I have them in a size 6, and they work great. They are soft and comfortable. I have to wear them every day. I have been using them to keep my hands warm for the past year and I am very pleased. I wish they were the size I was wearing. I have a size 6 and they are very comfortable. I have not tried"
CG,"While I do most of my running, I'd say I'm not going to be using the extra weight from the floor. I am using the extra weight to keep the legs strong and straight. The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."
CG,"These goggles have the best of both worlds.  The lenses are easy to install and the colors are bright.  The only drawback is that they're a little tight on the eyes.  If you need to change lenses, I would suggest using a mesh lens to secure the lenses.  I have a pair of these and they are a great pair of goggles.  I also own a pair of these goggles with the original lenses and they are very comfortable and a good value for the money.I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just about everything.  The color is bright, the leather is soft and the straps are sturdy.  It is very warm and comfortable.  I would recommend it for those of us who are not concerned about our hair.  It is light weight and very comfortable.  I have a large head and this is perfect for that.  I have the large"

CG,"I bought the Wave to go with the wide brim. I also wanted to give the wave a different appearance so I had to get a solid version of the Treme. The Wave is made of a material that is highly viscous, which is why it was so popular. The wave also has a 2-piece design to it, which is great for a wedding band. I also like the shape of the wave, which is nice for wedding ceremonies. The waves are very easy to wash and dry, which is a nice feature. I really like the wave.

I was very surprised at how well the Wave worked. It was a little too warm for me to wear on a chilly day, but it was a nice touch. It also kept my hair from getting stuck on my head. I also liked that the wave was made of a good material. I wish it had a thicker material, but I don't think I will"
CG,"The heart rate function works fine. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.

The only problem is that it requires a little tightening.

The crank should also be a bit smaller than I wanted it to be.

I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheap replacement for a crank that is on a different brand.

I will update if I find another one.

CG,I purchased this bike online and it arrived on time. I will update this review if I find a difference. I had a friend who was very happy with her bike. She was skeptical that it was a bicycle. She says it is very sturdy. This one is a little bit larger than she thought. She says it is heavier than she thought. So it is a little heavier than she expected. It does not have a lot of grip on it. It is well made and does not come with a disc brake. The only thing I would change is that it has a small vent on it to allow it to sit upright. It is a little thicker than I thought. I am not sure why it is thinner. I would prefer it to be thicker. It is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. It is very small and I think it would be very uncomfortable for someone. I would not recommend this bike to anyone.
CG,"I purchased two of these and have been using them for two months now. They are very durable and will last for a long time. I also like the fact that the adjustable height is adjustable to adjust the width of the belt so it stays in place. This is a great feature for the price. I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a calf. I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the inner thighs. I am 5'4"", 165lbs and these are perfect!  I would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone. This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but it is thin enough for me to wear in the holster. It is very well made and feels great."
CG,"I rated my Okuma abf-30 (Cordura) in the 4th percentile for the size and weight. I had to replace the ""regular"" ring with a new ring, and now it's a little smaller. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my Mossberg 990b. I love the fact that it is a bit smaller than I thought. I have had trouble with the rubber on the top part of my Mossberg 990b. It has a little bit of a squall on it but it's not that big. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as tight as I thought it would be. I wish it had a little more compression on the top part. I would definitely recommend this product. Works as advertised."
CG,"You can read the feature description on the packaging, which says it's for ""heavy duty"" use.  The packaging says it's ""light weight"" and ""good for light duty"" use.  It's not light weight, but it's light weight.  If you have a light weight suit, this is the one you want.  If you don't have a light weight suit, this is the one you want.  If you have a heavy duty suit, this is the one you want.

CG,"I have been using the Topeak HRX for a while now and have been using the HRX for about a year now. The HRX is a solid, strong, and comfortable HRX. It is a perfect fit for my needs and is comfortable. The only thing I would change is to order the XL, which is the standard size for the HRX. I would buy the XL again. The XL is great for a well made HRX, and is comfortable to wear. The XL is also great for my wrists, which is nice. I am 6'2"" and 160lbs, and the XL is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and 160lbs, and the XL fits my wrists perfectly. I would recommend this HRX for the price. UPDATE:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
CG,"I've purchased a bore snake (Cobra) and this one fits my Colt 1911 perfectly. The other two have the same design, but they're slightly different. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a good value for the money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He's been using it all season and it is a great quality product. I just wish there was a way to replace the metal bars on the bottom of the basket. The material is soft and durable. The color is black and the handle is very well made. This basket is super light and easy to carry. The basket is not too big, which makes it easier to carry around. The basket is a bit small for my daughter's size 9 and I think it will be a little easier to carry than the basket I have. I have a size 9 and it is small, but that is not a bad thing."
CG,"decent basic walleye rig.  Not an easy task to put together, but for the price, it's a great buy.  I am a 32 oz female and wear a 34 in this bag.  I am not in the water, so I have not had to worry about getting wet.  I am not a fan of the orange color, but the orange is a nice color.  I am quite pleased with the quality of this bag.  I have a size 32 and am very happy with the size.  I would definitely recommend this bag to any woman who needs a nice big bag to keep her hands warm or dry.

UPDATE:  I received a second pair of these bags on December 8, 2017.  I received these bags within a week of receiving them and they are now my favorite.  I highly recommend this bag for anyone who is in need of a small bag to keep their hands warm or dry."

The scope is very well made and it was easy to install and holds my AR-15 perfectly. The scope is also very compact and I can use it on my AR-15 without any problem. This scope is very bright and accurate. I have a good sight picture on this scope. I highly recommend this scope. I will definitely be buying more from this company. Good quality, and good price. A must have for any mount. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is bright and easy to install. I will be buying another one for my son soon. Love the design of this bag. It is small and compact, but well made and stylish. I will order another one."
CG,"Whereas this device is a little bulky, the materials are good enough. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It is a very nice design, and will do the job it is supposed to do.

CG,"This is a great rod, it is lightweight and easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, you can't take it off without it breaking. It is a good rod, it is very light and holds its shape very well. I would recommend this rod to anyone who has a rod. I bought these for my husband. They are very comfortable, and I love the fact that they are made of a hard plastic. The material is very soft, and I have no complaints about them. They also come with a small pocket on each side, and a long strap that allows you to carry things. I have to say that they are very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone. They are great. Very comfortable. I have worn them several times now and the only thing I have noticed is that they are very well made and they feel very well made. They are very soft and durable."

I am a 32 year old man who works at a large company and have had no issues with these gloves. I have had no issues with the gloves falling apart or breaking. They are the most comfortable I have ever worn and I am so happy with them. I recommend them to anyone looking for a glove that will last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these gloves to anyone looking for a great glove. These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality product.

CG,"After hitting a custom made valve on the side, it was a lot easier to fix the valve.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work now.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the bore hole. If you have a bore hole in the crank, the valve will not close. If you have a bore hole in the crank, the valve will not close.

I am returning it.

Update: After about a week of use, the valve has been completely screwed down and it has not budged a bit.

If you have a problem with it, please contact me via email. I'll be glad to help you. I'll update if I get a better one. I've had no problems with this valve.

CG,"I have some iron dumbbells that have the iron chain in them.  These have the iron chain in them so they don't get stuck.  The ring is a little too loose and the chain is too loose.  The next time I use them I will see if they would work.  They work great for the purpose.  I can't wait to use them.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time,"
CG,I'm a motorcycle camper.  I have the wide brim and the large brim for my small bike.  I wear a medium and the large.  The light is a nice light and it's bright.  It's not waterproof so it's not very warm and rainy.  The brim is a nice touch as well.  I also like the fact that it folds up so you can use it as a helmet cover.  I think that's important because it allows you to carry around a phone or other items when riding.  The pockets are nice and easy to store.  I'm a huge fan of the long handle bar so I wanted to try out this one.  I'll be ordering another one and shipping out to my destination.  I can't tell you how many times I've worn it.  It's very comfortable and I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB
CG,"CW-X simply nailed it with a hammer and the chain stays sharp.  This is a great product.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his bladder very well.  The straps are very comfortable and it has a very comfortable feel to it.  I also like the fact that it has a very nice rubber grip on the top of the bladder, so if you want to carry your bladder in the back of a car, you don't have to worry about a zipper breaking.  It is definitely a good addition to your bike.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and it does not have any compression on the belt. The holster does not come with a clip on the back that is attached to the holster. It is a good"

I would recommend it.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear he can use in his home.  This is not a tactical vest for him, but it is well made and will help him to organize his gear.  The included pockets are nice and easy to access.  This vest is super lightweight and packs well in a small case.  It's great for his training and practice.  I would definitely recommend this to any tactical person.  Great product for a good price.

I didn't want to spend the money for it and thought it was a waste of money. This is a great addition to my emergency kit. I will use it for my emergency kit.

I would recommend this product to anyone.This is an excellent product. I have used it for a year and have never had any problems with it. I use it for my elliptical workout and it has lasted me years. It is easy to use and it has a nice feel. It is a very good size for my purposes.

I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good workout for a week or more
CG,"I was missing a black one. The only reason I did not return it is because I just wanted a pair of the same color, but since they are both white, it is not that difficult to find one.

If you're thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely consider a pair of these. I did get a pair of the same color for my husband's birthday and my grandson's birthday. I used these for two years and he loved them. He said they were his favorite socks for the kids. They are really comfortable and he is actually getting a lot of compliments on them. They are definitely worth the money.They are not as big as I wanted, but I like them and they are comfortable.I bought these to use when I ride my bike at night.

Great product!Love this helmet for the price!  I wore it on the road for a few hours and it was a great helmet. It has a nice deep blue tint that doesn't fade at all.

CG,"The Contigo Jackie Water Bottle (Cordura) is a great inexpensive bottle for the money. It is so small that it is difficult to carry around the car, so it is not easy to drink from it.

I will be buying a larger size for my other water bottle.I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful. I have a very small hand and it is very comfortable to carry.

It does not have a flashing light on it, but it does have a flashing light on it. I would not recommend the flash light, but I am not sure that it is worth the money.

If you have a problem with a light on your front sight, get the second one. I have been using a red dot for years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only problem is that the sight is not the best for our needs. The flashing light is on the front and the rear.

It's very easy to pump and close the tube when needed. The pump works well, but it is a little small.I'm a big fan of the Casio HD7, but I can't find a single company that does anything like this. They're all ""top of the line"" brands, and I guess if you're looking for a little more money, look no further than Amazon.

My current purchase of the HD7 was the ""Top of the Line"" model. It was a lot more expensive than the HD7, and I had"
CG,"Before i start the review, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has provided their feedback. I had a lot of feedback from people that had not had a chance to use it yet. It was a little difficult to use for my comfort level, but once I got used to it, I was impressed. I had to work on my breathing so I could get more comfortable breathing. I am 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I have had trouble breathing on the floor because I am too small for my legs. This is a great feature and a great product. I have been using it for a few months now and I am still happy with it. I hope this helps to explain my review. I will update this review once i have the opportunity to use it. I would recommend this product to anyone. I really like these gloves. I have had a few pairs of these in the past and they are very comfortable and good quality."
CG,"So far after using this, it has held up fine.

If you have a larger head than 6'5"" you might want to get the head up a bit, but that's not a big deal.

I would recommend this if you are a large person. I don't think it's a huge deal, but if you have a larger head then you might want to do something else. I'm 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I'm 6'1"" and the head is too small for me. If you are just 6'1"" then it might work for you, but it's not a big deal.

I'm 6'1"" and I have a large head and I can tell that I'm about 5'8"", so I'm going to give it a shot. I would recommend this if you are 6'2"" or taller.

It's a great product, and I'm glad I got it.Works great for my 5 year old."
CG,"Something happens beyond 6 miles. I have an old stove that is still going strong. This is a great stove. I am using it for the colder months when it is not hot. I have been using it for a while and it is very effective. The only thing I would say is that it is heavier and I can't tell you how much lighter it is. I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is very easy to clean. I have a small, very light-colored coffee pot in my basement with a lid on it that is very easy to clean. I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean. I don't know if I have used it for anything but my coffee pot is pretty small, but that does not mean that I will have to clean it. The stove is very light and the lid is very light."
CG,"I got his Women's Silicone Roller & I Love It. I also love that it's been used to make two different sizes of roller, both of which have different weights. The only thing that I do like about this roller is that it's a little thicker than my previous one. The texture of the roller is very soft and it's a little thicker than my previous roller. I also like that the roller has a handle that can be used to push the roller down when I'm not using it. I also like that the roller has a small, rubber ring that I can use to hold it in place and put it on. The roller also has a tiny, plastic sleeve that I can use to cover my face. I also like that the roller has a rubber liner that I can use to keep my face warm and dry. I also like that the roller is a little more flexible and helps prevent wrinkles. Overall I really like this roller and would recommend it to anyone. I bought this roller for my wife and she loves it."
CG,"I have NEVER, EVER, had a problem with the knee pads being stretched or pulled up too much. These are not the best pads, but they are the best. They do NOT stretch or pull up when you are sitting on a bench. This is why I ordered these. They are comfortable and have a great feel. They are made well and I am very happy with them. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary. I'm glad I found this. I have used this for a couple of months now. It is very easy to use and to set up. It is very quiet. I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I use this to hold a 5 pound bow and it is good."
CG,"My favorite FLIP UP sights are the Taurus and the Taurus G17. I have one in my 6th FLIP UP, and it is the Taurus G17. This is the best optic I have ever owned. I was skeptical about the price of this product. I knew I was getting a good value, but I was wrong. I was shocked at how much more expensive it was than the most expensive gas stove I could find. I thought that I would have to return it to Amazon, but I was wrong. I purchased this stove for my first camping trip in a tent with no rain cover. I have used it for three days now, and it is still working as I expect. I was disappointed to see that the front of the stove has not fallen off or damaged. I have used it several times now, and I have not had a problem. I am very happy with this stove. I would buy again. This is a great quality set of gloves. They are made well and are comfortable."
CG,"I bought this in LA and it arrived on time. I will be purchasing a second one in the same color.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The material is very durable, and it will last for years.  I would highly recommend this product.I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a pair.  I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the back.  I love that they are made of a soft fabric and are very stretchy.  I do like that they are not too big to wear on the trail.  They are well made and I would recommend them to anyone.I like the color and quality. I have a little pinky finger in the pinky finger area. I like the fact that it has a little pinky side. I have a small pinky finger in the middle. This is a little tight at first, but after wearing it for about 5"
CG,"These grips blow me away. I love the feel of the grip. The grip is awesome. If you want to get a solid grip then this is the one you should go for. I had no issues with this knife. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that it is very heavy and hard to carry. I also have a very heavy blade with a very sharp edge and it is difficult to get the knife out of the sheath. I hope the knife is a good value for the money. This is a very good quality, and very well made. The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot use it as a gun, but it does work as a handgun. I would recommend it for a gun like a Ruger or M&P-15. I have used this for years. I bought the first one for my wife and she loves it. She is a 5'6"" woman and the other one for her daughter."

I have been shooting at night for several years now, and this is the first time I have seen a scope with a single pointed scope.  I am very happy with this scope.  I would buy it again.  I am very happy with this purchase.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of the soft materials and they do not rust. They do not come with any attachments to attach to my bike. They are made well and I am very happy with the purchase!Works great, but I have no idea how to use it.

CG,"The light came well-packed, and the lens was very bright. I also received a 2x2"" extra large lens.  The front sight mount is very light-weight and is very easy to install.  The mount is very easy to install and the light comes with two large rings for the mounting pin.  I also received one extra large lens.  The mount is very light-weight and easy to install.  I can't tell you how much easier it is to install.  The mount is also very easy to mount.  I received two extra small lenses.

I received this light at a discount in exchange for my honest review.I have a Nikon D810, and I like this one. I also like the color and the way the mount is adjustable. It's a little hard to see the dot from my camera, but I'm glad I got it. It's very well made and pretty bright. I've used this for a few days now and it's holding up great. The only thing I would change would be to get"
CG,"I have other pairs of this. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the TRS-4 and it does not fit well. It does not stay in place. If you are looking for a good shoe with a strong shoe, this is the shoe for you.I ordered a second set of these gloves. They are great, but I wish they had an on/off switch. They are not very comfortable for me, so I'm going to leave them in the kids room. I was just getting them off the box and put them on. They are a little too big for my hands. They do work well for my wrists, but they are too small for my hands. They are also too small for my hands. I would have liked to have used a larger pair. I wish they had a on/off switch. I have the 4-5 inch wrist. They are very comfortable. They fit my wrists well and I am very happy with them. They are made of a high quality"
CG,"installation is straight forward and easy to follow.  The included instructions are simple, but the instructions are a bit long.  I am not sure how the instruction booklet would be written, but it is well written.  The instructions are very clear.  I am not sure how the instructions could be altered to accommodate a different color, but the instructions seem to be very clear.  I did not have to remove the wire from my AR.  I have a Beretta M&P 223 with a Magpul Eotech.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.

Overall, this is a well designed and well made product.  I highly recommend it.This is a great pair of goggles. I have to say, I am not a big fan of the color. It has a little red dot on the top, which is supposed to be very distracting. I don't really like the color at all. I thought it was pretty cool. I really liked the colors. The material is good. The goggles themselves are very comfortable and I can wear them while"
CG,"Received my tent last week and it arrived on time. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two.  The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight. The only complaint is that the cover is a little loose around the bottom of the tent. I haven't used it yet, but it will be a great addition to my bag.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time, but I'm going to try and buy another one for my husband.I'm a big fan of these balls and would recommend"
CG,"I don't use these in the woods, but they are good enough to make a difference. I highly recommend them. I am a 32 year old man, so I don't have to worry about wearing them in the woods. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a spare tire, and the strap is a bit loose, but it's great that it is on the pack. The strap does a good job of keeping the pack in place, and I like the quality. I don't have to pull it down with my hands, but I do have to pull it up and keep the top of my head up. I use this to hang a pack of cigarettes and other stuff that I don't want to get in the way of my trip."
CG,"I did like this tent, it has the wide brim which is a nice feature for the price. The tent is adjustable and can be used for many different types of camping. The tent is made of a material that is durable and waterproof. The size is adjustable and is made of a material that is a bit smaller than most tents. I would recommend this tent to anyone who wants to take a different style of camping to the next level.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones.  You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it and it will work great.  I would recommend this product.  I am very happy with it.I got this to replace my old one I had. It's awesome. It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal screws are a little too long for my 1911, but that's not really a problem.

CG,"Well designed blade paired with a 9mm Remington. I will keep this blade in my collection. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight and it will hang out over the gun with no issues. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight. I will order a pair again, and they will fit him well. I love this mat. I have been using it for several months now and it is very comfortable."
CG,"I purchased the Simmons LRF (LRF) as a replacement for the LRF I had purchased.  The Simmons LRF is a solid and reliable light.  It is very bright and it is well designed.  The Simmons LRF is very light and compact.  The Simmons LRF is a great light.  I also love the fact that it is a little heavier than the Simmons LRF.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an affordable light.  The Simmons LRF is also very easy to install.  I highly recommend it.

I have a Simmons LRF and am happy with it.

I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are looking for a lightweight, compact light.  It is bright and bright enough to see through a vehicle.  It is light enough to keep in the car for about a minute.  I would suggest purchasing a light that is a little lighter than the Simmons LRF if you are looking for a lightweight light that is just as bright.

CG,"...for me anyway, I prefer this to the wide-open-and-unzipped version.

The top is a nice, solid, clear plastic plastic, so it doesn't slip around.

The bottom is a thin plastic plastic, but it is still very durable.

I prefer the shorter version, because it is easier to open and close without damaging the top.

It does come with a few items to use, but it is well made and will last for years to come.

If you want to know more about this, I suggest reading a few reviews before buying.

I do recommend it to anyone.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I want to make sure my other products are safe, and I'm not sure how long it will hold up.  I'll say this after I've used it for some time, but I think I'll give it another try.  If I don't like it, I'll buy another one.  My 3 year old loves it.

CG,"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

I was going to buy a second one but I wanted a little more cushioning to cushion my back and back.  This one is just as good.  The material is good and the straps are very soft.  I'll update this review when I find a new one.  I will be buying another one.This is the only one I have that"

CG,"I like this multi-pack as it has the wide opening for two full packs of water. I just use a pair of the open front ones.  The open front one is great for storing water or food.  It has a large storage capacity.  I like the two large pockets for the pockets.  I also like the fact that the compartment is made of several different pockets.  I like the fact that the compartment is made of an adjustable strap.  It's very easy to open and close the compartment.

The included pockets are nice and easy to store.  There's a small pouch that is a good size for water, but it's not big enough to hold a full bladder.  There's a small small pouch for air, but it's not huge enough to hold a full bladder.  It's very small for a small tent.

The tent is very spacious.  It has a wide opening for water.  There are two other compartments that can hold water.  The other compartment is just a smaller one that has a narrower opening that can be used for cooking.  The zipper is a nice feature that keeps the water out of the zipper. "
CG,"Ok so I've seen a few of the other reviews saying that it's too small for my arms.

I had to get a size small and the shoulders are a bit large. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the fit and feel of this shirt. I am very happy with it and it will be a great addition to my collection.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but it's not too heavy. It's a good pistol, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's bright and bright. I've had no problems with the battery, and the sight is great. I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB and other ride-hiking bikes.Works great for my husband.  He loves it.  He does not like it when he rides on the trails.  He will be buying more.This is the only bag I have ever used that"
CG,Outstanding fuel.  This is a real fuel cell stove.  My husband and I have been using this stove for over a year now.  The stove is very easy to set up and maintain.  We have been using it for a few days now.  The burner has a lot of power.  The burner is the most efficient type of fuel source available.

I'm a bit skeptical about the price, but they are not cheap.  I'll have to order another pair.  I have a pair of these for my son and my husband.  I highly recommend these to anyone who needs one.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. The front and back of the case are easy to adjust and it holds the keys. The pocket clip on the front of the case is well made and has a nice pocket clip for my phone and keys. The mount was a little too tight, but that is no big deal. The batteries in the case are on the low side, and the side of the case is tight. The case is not as sturdy as the small case on the other side of the case, but it is a good buy.The belt does not seem very durable.  The bag does not have a lot of padding to it, which makes it a"

I have been using this knife for several years.  I use it for hiking and fishing and it's great for taking the kids to the beach.  It's a great knife for the price.  I would not buy again.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones.  You can change the strap length, but it won't fit into the front pocket or it won't work with my other straps.  I can't say how long it will be, but it's a nice accessory.I bought these to use when I ride my bike at night. They are a little hard to pull off the seat but I do. I ordered the four on the low end because I was afraid of them being too tight. They are very comfortable and they fit well and are very comfortable.

I do wish they had a large head to make it easier to wear them on my head. They are adjustable and they are a little tight on my head. I have a small head"

CG,"I didn't like this hat, it was too long and too thin. I have a large head.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big guy. He likes it so much, he ordered one for himself.  The hat is light and compact.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will probably order another one for myself.  I've had this for about a year now and I love it.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones, but I prefer the smaller ones.  They fit my wrist perfectly.  I'm 6'3"" and this is perfect for my wrist.  I'm not a big guy, but I do have to make sure my wrist is not too tight.  I've had no problems with this being too tight, but I have to adjust it to my wrist.

I would recommend this bag to anyone who wants a quality bag that is not too tight and is just right for their needs.  I'll be ordering more of these in the future."
CG,"After a good charge, I noticed a noticeable difference in the pressure of the bat. I ran the bat twice a day and it hit a solid 32 FPS, and the bat was very stable.

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very comfortable. I've used it with a stick, and it doesn't seem to be that bad. I'll probably only buy one more bat from this company, as it's pretty pricey. I'm going to try and purchase another one at some point.I'm always looking for a lightweight shirt to wear when riding my bike. This one is exactly what I was looking for. It is very comfortable and fits perfectly in the back pocket of my jacket. "
CG,This hammock is the size that will fit the long legs of a Giro bike. It has a nice two-person fold-down design and is light and easy to take on and off. It is also very comfortable to sit on. The construction is very sturdy and the fabric is also very strong. The hammock is made of a very durable material and is very strong. I will say that I will probably not buy this hammock again. I have a hard time finding hammocks that have a strong construction. I would definitely recommend this hammock for anyone who needs a hammock that will last a long time. I used this for a couple of months and it did not break. I did have some problems with the belt being pulled tight around the waist. I also had a few issues with the belt not fitting properly. I have no idea how to fix this. I will update this post if I find a way to fix it. My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose. If you have a large handle and it's loose you will feel a little pressure on your hands. If you have a large handle and it's loose it will be harder to grip the handle.
CG,"The only reason I gave this a 3 star is because I didn't want to throw it off. It's not the best design, but it is the best product. The only other reason I gave it 4 stars is because I didn't want to use it for some reason. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I had to use it to start the day. I didn't want to use it to do it for any reason. I just wanted to see if it could do that. It works well, but I really don't want to use it to do that. I just wanted to see if it could do it for me. I don't know how you can ever know if you're doing something wrong. It's a great product, and I'll be buying more of it. I'll definitely keep it for my wife.I have used this tent for several years now and have not had any problems. I used this tent on a boat ride in the summer of 2012 and it has held up well.

CG,"This filter worked great!  We have had the bottle for two weeks now and have not been disappointed.  The top is a nice bright red and the bottom is a nice dark blue.  We have had no issues with the filter, and it's not very heavy.  The filter also works well with the line adapter I purchased.  The plastic top on the top is a nice touch for my purposes.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate line adapter for their water bottles.This is my second EZK-2, and I haven't had a problem with this one yet. It is definitely a better value than the original. I bought it for my wife, and she loves it. I also like the color and the way the liner is folded. It's a great little product, and she can't wait to use it.

My only complaint is that the liner is not really the right length for the tightest use. I have a 5'6"" woman with a 34"" waist, and she usually goes for a loose fit. I've had a pair of these at least once, and the seamstress never came by to help with her fit. She said the liner was too tight, and I had"
CG,"After a few months of use, the quality has improved.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I am a 32 year old man, so it is not that big of a deal.

If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely go with a smaller one. I did have a problem with the opening on the back of the bag, but I had to use a little lubricant on it. I will update this review if I find any issues with it.

I like the fact that they do not have a side seam, which is nice.  I do like the fact that they do not have any mesh, which is nice.

CG,"Summary: Great silicone wedding band.  The only problem is that it's a little too large for my size 6.5.  The band is too small for my body shape.  The color is a little too pink.  The band is very thin and doesn't stretch very well.  The bands are very thin and it's difficult to wear them on my hands.  They will probably stay put for a while.  I'm not sure how long they will last, but they are definitely worth the money.

CG,"This is a must have for anyone who wants to try out a new bat for the first time.

I had a friend who was going to have a bat in a local store that had a similar bat and we were using it for batting practice. This bat was great and we loved it. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it and it fit our needs.

We just went to Walmart and bought a new bat. It was $30 cheaper than the old bat and we were thrilled with the price. The bat was a little heavy so we put it in a bag with it and put it in a closet where it would be kept. We were able to put it in the cooler and we couldn't get it into the cooler. It was a good fit and we were able to bat practice with it.

It is a good bat and we are glad we purchased it. It is a great bat and I would recommend it to anyone.We bought this tent for our boat on the east coast of Mexico.

I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and it does not have any compression on the belt.

CG,"never understood why girls would go to the gym and try out different exercises for a variety of reasons.

I had to get a girl to get the instruction booklet so I could go to the gym and look at the various exercises. The booklet was a little confusing to me. I knew I was looking at a girl and it seemed to me that the instruction booklet was a little more confusing than I expected. I tried to figure out how to get the instructions to work, but I couldn't do that because I couldn't see the instructions. I'm not sure why the booklet was so confusing to me but I thought maybe that was because it didn't work.

I'll update this review if I find it helpful.

Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.

I then tried to push my legs on the floor and tried to push the plates on the floor.  I am still not sure how well it works, but I'm very pleased with it.

The rifle is a bit too small for a compact pistol, but the rifle is well built and well made.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a gun that will last a long time.I got this for my son's birthday, but he does not like it.  It is too big and too small and he is too young to use it.  He is not very creative and it is too hard to take to the range.  It is too big and too small for his hand.  He also does not like it.  It was too big for him and he is too small.  He does not like the fact that it is too small, but he does not like the fact that it is too large.  It is too big and it is too small.

The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.

It is a perfect size for my size 7.5-8.5 hips. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do.

The pack is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built. It has a nice, high quality strap that is very easy to attach and remove. The sleeve is very comfortable and I like that it does not have any pockets for my phone, which is a plus.

I am also very happy with the sizing of the pack, as I am very confident that this will be a very good fit for me. I am a tall woman, and I am normally 5'6"", about 200 lbs.

The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike.

They are not very comfortable for me, so I'm going to leave them in the kids room. I was just given a free pair of gloves for review purposes. They are a little too big for me, but they do work. I would definitely recommend them to my son.They are great. Very comfortable. I have worn them several times now and the only thing I have noticed is that they are very well made and don't get very hot or sweaty. I will order a second pair if I can get a warm one. The material is good. The straps are very soft and comfortable. I wear them under my belt and have not had any issues. They are very easy to set up and I can't imagine having to remove them.

I would highly recommend this stove to anyone who wants to use this as a cooking utensil.  I have also found it very easy to use and easy to clean.  I will say that I will keep it in the house for a long time and will update this review if I find any issues.

Update:  I purchased this stove for my first camping trip in July 2014.  I am still using it at the moment, and I have not had a problem with it.  The stove does a good job of keeping my fire lit.

He has great upper body strength and will pull up to a 40 degree.  He likes that he can carry around his phone, keys, and other stuff.  I use this with my pack, camping, and other gear.  I like that it has a couple of pockets for some tools and a small storage pouch for some other stuff.  I also like that it is easy to carry around and move around.

I also love the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I wear it to keep my hands warm and warm with a good amount of circulation.  I also like that the ring is smaller than I expected.  I also like the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside of my hand.  I'm not a big fan of the padding on the inside, but I don't like the fact that it's less than an inch.  I don't have to worry about the padding going up a bit in the middle of the day, but I do have to be careful of the texture.  I'm not a big guy and I'm not sure what's going on inside the ring.  I don't like that it's a little more than an inch, but I like that it doesn't feel like it's going to get any bigger than I was expecting.  I like the way it's made and the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside.  I think I'll order another pair of these"
CG,"This is, quite simply, a better set of grips than the standard grip.

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight. The grip is a bit too small to be comfortable, but the grip is not stiff enough to be comfortable. I would not recommend this grip to anyone who is considering purchasing this grip.

Overall, this grip is a solid quality product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great grip. I am happy with my purchase.I love the way this holster fits.  The grip is comfortable and the gun is easy to conceal.  I can tell that I am getting a lot of use out of this holster.  I have no complaints about this holster.

I highly recommend it to any adventurer.I bought this for my wife and it is amazing. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid.

CG,"One Con that's acceptable enough, and not too bad, is that it's a little hard to put on.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic strips to get it to work properly.  It's not a huge deal, but it is very annoying to put on.  I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a more compact bike.  It's a nice bike, but it's not a great one.  It will work fine for me, but I wouldn't recommend it.

I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do. The other review I have read said the handle is too small.

I use it in conjunction with my wife's weekly work out and exercise routine.  I've had it for a few months now and it's very effective.  I'm impressed.

It's not a terrible feature, but I find it frustrating that there's always a manual entry that is only a couple of lines long.  I have to go to a computer and type in my code to get a new computer and it's a hassle.

The only problem is that it's not very easy to get it to work, which is not a huge deal.  It's difficult to get it to run"

I will update this review if I ever need to use this item again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install. I was able to keep it and put it in my closet without it getting in the way of my work. The netting is very sturdy and I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it and do not want it to get in the way of your work.

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to pull off. The sights are bright, and the gun fits nicely in my pack. It's a little difficult to get the gun to shoot the gun if you want to. It's not as loud as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as loud as I expected.

I don't really like the mounting hardware, so I'll leave that up to the seller. It's not a bad product, but it's not a very good one. I'll update this review when I find a better one.I bought this bag because I was very happy with the size and comfort of my new bike.  I was worried that this bag would be a little big, but it's a small bag that is very comfortable and compact.  I love that the handlebars are adjustable, but they are not a huge deal.

I just wish there was a way to access the stove from the back of the car so I can take it out of the car without having to pull it out of the car.  I have a spare stove and it is a good price for the equipment it comes with.  It is a very good starter kit and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a starter kit for their stove.Great quality.

I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.

CG,"I'm not sure why some people say the design is just too smooth.  I think it's because the two top screws are too small.  The other top screws are too large and the screws aren't in the right places.  The glue on the bottom screws is very thin.  I don't think this is the case with the M-16.  I've had the M-16 for a few months now and it is working fine.  It's very easy to open and close the bolt when I'm doing my pull-up bar.  I haven't had a problem with it closing.

The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

It is very comfortable and comfortable. I wish the grip was a little larger for my hands. I would have liked the option to have the grip have the handle side up. I would have liked the end of the grip to be a little larger for my hands. I have been using it for several years and I would have liked the grip to be a little larger for my hands.

CG,"I purchased this eco-city light for my husband. It is very bright and easy to use.  It is so bright that it is bright enough to get the job done.  I used this to light my car and it worked great.I use this as a hiking lantern. The light is bright enough to see through the rain and it is very easy to turn on and off. I will say that I have to use a little bit of torque to turn it off when I go hiking. I have to get it on the ground. I use this to light my tent up to 6 people and it does help a lot.I used this for a couple of months and it did not work as I expected.  I returned it.  It is a great product and I would recommend it.I am a 35 year old man with a large head and a medium.  This is my first helmet helmet and I am hoping that I will have a better fit on this helmet than I have before.  I am 5'10"", 125lbs and it was a little difficult to get it to fit my head.  I am now wearing it and it fits well and I am pleased with it.  It is the only helmet I have that does not have a neck strap.  I bought a small size for my nephew and it fits perfectly on him.  I bought the large size because the neck strap is a bit smaller than mine.  I am a big guy and it is a bit large for me.  I am going to buy a large size for my nephew and it fits perfectly"
CG,"I found this bag to be an excellent quality bag. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two bikes. The front of the bag is the plastic part of the bag and the back is the metal part of the bag. The size is perfect and the bag has no issues with straps breaking. I have also found it to be very comfortable and easy to carry. I also like the fact that there is a separate compartment for the two bags. I will be returning this bag to Amazon for a second one. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was just getting a little tired of wearing my long pants. They didn't fit me perfectly. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a well made backpack.I bought these to use when hiking and for my family.  They are a little hard to pull off the mountain but I do like them.  I have a large head and the size fits me perfectly.  I like the quality of these gloves.  They are made well and are made well.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality pair of gloves.I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", and it is a little large, but it is nice and light. She loves it. The color is a little darker than the stock color, but that's okay with me.

It comes with a nice cover and a handy wrist strap that is nice and secure. There is a way to remove the cover with a screwdriver, but that's not a good feature.

I haven't used it yet."
CG,"I bought this bag and it has been an awesome experience.  I also have a large one.  The extra pocket is nice, but it is a little tight.  I used this to hold my camera and in case I needed to use it as a backup to my camera.  It was a great bag, I did not want to be able to carry a camera with me.  I would recommend this bag to anyone who is considering purchasing this bag.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built.

It does not slide around on the car.  I like the shape of the ring.  I have also noticed that it is very easy to hold with a strong hand.  I do not recommend it for anyone who is not experienced with the ring.

The stitching is very well made, the stitching is pretty straight, and it's not overly stiff.  The size is perfect and I like the shape of the straps.  I have a large chest and I can wear the ankle strap without any issues.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a compression type thing that can be worn comfortably.

CG,"These are fantastic! They fit perfect on my Glock 17. I also love that they have a full sized inner barrel.  The front sight is also very light and easy to adjust.  The only thing I would change is the size of the scope.  This is a great optic for the money.  I have a 11"" scope on the Springfield XD scope with a telescopic sight.  I would buy these again.  I am very happy with these sights.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of these socks. I wear them daily to keep warm, and I like that they keep me from sweating. They also keep my feet warm and dry. I do recommend these socks to anyone. My only complaint is that I have a large head. I am 6'2"" and the size 6 fit my head. I would recommend these socks for anyone.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my front end, and it's very comfortable to ride. The seat itself is a bit on the stiff side, but it's not a problem. It's also easy to install and adjust. The seat is a little big for me, but it's a lot of room for storage. I ride a Honda Civic with a seatpost for my bike, and it's a little too large for my bike. It's not a big deal, but I'm not a big fan of the seatpost at all. I think I would have preferred to"

The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.  I really don't care that much about the color, so I guess I will just buy the colors.This is the only one I have that will fit my Glock 22 perfectly.  The only negative is that it's a little too large.  If you're going to carry this, you'll need to get a larger size.  It's a little bulky for my Glock 22.  I'll be getting another one for the Glock 22.  I'm happy with this one.I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loves it.  It is a great value for"
CG,"Overall this is a great starter kit and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great starter kit and I think it will last a long time. I have a few other kit on my bike and a few other bikes that have been very good, but this is by far the best I have found. I have a spare tire, and a spare tire that fits on my bike. I have to get the bike mounted on the bike and to make sure the bike is not sitting on the side of the bike. My bike is sitting on the side of the bike with the tire on. If the bike is sitting on the side of the bike, I can't mount it on the bike. This is a very serious problem for me, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy this one. I was very excited to receive this bike and was very happy with the purchase. It's very comfortable to ride, and I'm very happy with the quality of the bike and the quality of the materials.

CG,"My boys (ages 10 and 13) love the swimming pool.  We also have a large pool.  The pool is open to the outside and is easy to clean.  The pool is comfortable and well ventilated.  We have used it for swimming and swimming pool play.  It is a great place to have the pool and hang out.  It is a great pool for adults and children.  The pool is nice and spacious.  I like that the pool is easy to clean.  I do wish the pool had a little extra room for our small children to sit on and play.  They like that it is easy to clean and not have to clean up the pool.

I'm 5'11"" and 140lbs and the pool is a good size for me.  I don't have to worry about the pool getting dirty.  The pool is pretty small, but not too big.  I will probably get a little more room in the pool.  The pool is very good quality, but not very large.  I would definitely buy this again.

The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field. It is very easy to use and to assemble. It does not interfere with the wind or rain. I highly recommend this tool.This is the best looking sight for the money.  It does the job and does it really well.  The only problem I have is that it does not have a rear sight mount.  I just needed something to mount on my Magpul G26.  The mount does not have a front sight.  The mount does not mount on a M4.  I don't have any problems with this sight.  The only negative is that it does not have the front sight mount.  I have been using this sight on my M4 and M4A1.  It is very difficult to mount the rear sight.  I also have had problems with the front sight not having the mount.  This is a very poor sight.  I would not recommend this sight to anyone.  I bought this sight for my Ruger"

I just wish it had a little more plastic, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no issues with this bottle. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable.  The straps are very comfortable and the bottle is very easy to hold.  The bottle is very easy to put on and take off.  The only negative I have is that I have to press it to get it to open the mouth.  I know that sometimes you need to press it to get it to open but it is really difficult to get it to open.  It is a very difficult bottle to open and to close it.  It is very easy to put on and it is super easy to clean.  It is very easy to clean and I would recommend this to anyone.My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I like the idea of this being a little more rounded. But that's not the case.

CG,"It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

Overall, this product was very well received and was a great addition to my bike.My husband loves this shirt. He loves that it is made of a thin material and that it has a large chest pocket.  He does wear this shirt on the weekends and he does not mind being able to wear it all the time.  It is comfortable and fits him very well.I have a little old guy and it's a little big for him.

It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the ground. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock, but it was a little difficult to get it to get into the ground.

We did not expect to be able to set it up with the hammock on it. However, the hammock is very light and easy to set up. We have not had a problem with the hammock getting stuck on something. We also have had to take it out of the hammock and put it in the back of a truck. The hammock is very easy to set up and it is very easy to adjust to your comfort level.

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid.

This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the price. I ordered the full size and it's just a bit too small. I'd be more inclined to order the larger size. I just can't get it to fit my AR.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I use this for my cycling training. I usually use this to keep my blood flow in check and helps my muscles relax. I also use it for my work out as well. I have to keep it in my pack for my work out. I will be buying another one for my home gym.This is a good product.  It is small and compact, but well made.  It is very comfortable.  I use it to hang a 5-foot pole in the garage.  I have been using it for several months now and it seems to be doing great.  I would recommend this product.I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He loved them! They were perfect for his needs. He also loves the colors and the size. He will definitely order more!Very nice and well made.  I bought them for my husband's birthday and he loves them.  The quality is good.I've had a few of these knives before, this one is my favorite. It is a very good knife and I have used them for a few years. The blade is very sharp and has a nice feel to it. It has a very solid sheath"
CG,"First of all, all these are not the only materials you need to keep in your pack.  The other two materials are the plastic, which is designed to be ""good"" and ""bad"" and is hard to get off your head.  If you're looking for something that will hold up to abuse, these are the ones you should buy.  If you're looking for something that will hold up to abuse, these are the ones you should buy.

I got these from Amazon for free, but I'd be happy to send them back for free again.

I'm glad I found these.  They're very soft and comfortable.  They're a bit difficult to put on and take off, but I've been using them for a few months now and have no issues with them getting in the way.

CG,"Let me start by saying that this is an awesome knife for the money.  I have one in my family and the other in my office.  The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

UPDATE:  The knife has been back in the USA and I haven't had to return it yet.  I'm very happy with it. "
CG,"I ordered this resistance band for my husband. It is very comfortable and easy to adjust.  It is so small that it is not easy to get around if you are a little large.  It is very comfortable to wear in a gym.  My husband is a large guy and the straps are too small for him to keep them in place.  He is a strong guy and will probably want to buy another one.  I am very happy with this product.I love these socks! They are light, easy to put on, and they are comfortable! I recommend them.These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.Great product, great price. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't had any issues with them on my bike. I recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to use them.Great buy. My wife and I have used them many times and we always use them. We have tried them on our mamma bike, and we always love them. They seem to be very durable and last much longer than any other brand we have tried. The material is very durable and the colors are very vibrant. It is really easy to adjust and change colors. I also think that the padding is a little snug for my wife and her wrist, but that is because she is in the wheelchair. She has tried a lot of different brands, but never had any issues with it.I've used these for about a year now and have been using them for a year and a half now. They are a bit stiff for me, but they are"
CG,"I bought this light on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to my bike. It is so bright and bright I am able to see the light from the side and it is easy to adjust to fit in the trunk of my car. This light is excellent. The light is bright enough to see my bike and it also has a low profile on the front so you don't have to worry about it falling off. The light is bright enough to see when I am riding in the dark and it is easy to see when I am out in the dark. I am 6' and 185 lbs and the light is great for someone with a large head. It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector. It is a good deal for a single source light and it is good enough for someone who is always looking for a bright light to use when riding on the road. It does not come with any locking or locking mechanisms and I can't see anything from the outside.

I have a large head and this light is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and my head is a little long so I am not too big. I am 6'5"" and it fits perfectly. I like that it has a good cross section and the side mirrors are easy to see through. I like that the cross section is also very easy to adjust and that the back mirrors are adjustable. I like that the mirror is adjustable and the cross section is adjustable for those that like to have a"
